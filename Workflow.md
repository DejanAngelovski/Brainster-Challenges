Steps taken for completing the task:

1. Cloned the BrainsterChallenges_DejanAngelovskiFE11 repo.
2. While on the main branch,created a new branch locally named "challenge-(challenge number)".
3. Navigated to the new branch with "git checkout" command.
4. Coppied files from the appropriate challenge, to the local repo folder.
5. Added and commited the changes while still on the new branch.
6. Pushed branch to remote.
7. Repeated the same steps for every challenge.

I hope this explains the workflow for Challenge-06
